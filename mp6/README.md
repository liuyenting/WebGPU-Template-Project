# MP6: Histogram Equalization

## Objective
The purpose of this lab is to implement an efficient histogramming equalization algorithm for an input image. Like the image convolution MP, the image is represented as RGB `float` values. You will convert that to GrayScale `unsigned char` values and compute the histogram. Based on the histogram, you will compute a histogram equalization function which you will then apply to the original image to get the color corrected image.
