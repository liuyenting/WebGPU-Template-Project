# MP5.2: List Scan

## Objective
The purpose of this lab is to implement one or more kernels and their associated host code to perform parallel scan on a 1D list. The scan operator used will be addition. You should implement the work- efficient kernel discussed in lecture. Your kernel should be able to handle input lists of arbitrary length. However, for simplicity, you can assume that the input list will be at most 2,048 * 2,048 elements.
